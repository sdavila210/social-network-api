  ## Installation
  This application is not deployed live, but it is a functional API which can be tested using Insomnia. The user will need to install express version 4.17.1, Mongoose version 7.0.2, and Insomnia to test.

  ## Usage

  When using this application, the user must run "npm start" to start the server, and then the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database. The user will be able to test the GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts and the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. The user can test the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia and be able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database. The user can test the user routes through http://localhost:3001/api/users. The user can test the thought routes through http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts. When the user is testing the POST user routes, they can input the following JSON request body into Insomnia: '{ "username": "user5", "email": "user5@gmail.com"}'. When the user is testing the thought POST route, they can inpute the following JSON request body into Insomnia to test: '{"thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...", "username": "lernantino", "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"}'. To post and delete friends from a user's friend list, the user can test through http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId. The following link demonstrates the functionality of the application.
